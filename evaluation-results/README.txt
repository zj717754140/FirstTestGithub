This code is used to genearte the figures in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7 of [1].

1. "results" contains the evaluation results (bounding box of each frame) for each tracker. 
2. "groundtruth" contains the groud truth of each sequence. 
3.  "figures" contains the figures in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
4. "plotSuccPre.m" is used to generate figures in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
5. "plotAllBest.m" is used to generate figures in Figure 7. 

The correspondence between the name of color model in the file name and in the figures is:

COPPONENT -> C-OPP
GRAY -> Intensity
HSV -> HSV
HUE -> Hue
LAB -> LAB
NOPPONENT -> N-OPP
NRGB -> rg
OPPONENT -> OPP
RGB -> RGB
TRGB -> TRGB
